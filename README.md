# Code Refactor Starter Code

The project goal is to refactor the site to meet accessibility standards and be optimal for search engines. 

## Scope of Work

- Inspect codebase to meet HTML accessibility standards and optimized for search engines. 
- Ensure HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Stylesheet requires consolidation and organization to follow semantic structure.
- Image elements should have accessible alternative attributes.
- Heading elements should follow a sequential order.
- Title elements should be concise and descriptive.

## Inspection results and Changes applied

1. HTML elements did not meet accessibility standards. Restructured elements' semantics to provide structure and imply the purpose of each element. 
2. Semantics provide codebase a logical structure with clear objectives and meaning.
3. Evaluated all elements "id" and "class" to meet proper organization and ensure links were adequately working. Updated elements to group by section's "class" and "id" to consolidate stylesheets code and remove repetitive or duplicate code.
4. All images were missing alternative attributes. Updated code to provide alternative text that describes the image and identifies the section.
5. Reviewed heading order. All heading is following a sequential order.
6. Updated the title to represent the institution and search engine ready.
